## AI Semantic Ticket Search — implemented (needs keys to activate)

Plain-language search that answers "has this issue been reported before, and
what happened to it?" with an AI summary on top and the matching real tickets
below, on three surfaces: admin dashboard, rep submission form, and public
status board.

- **Architecture:** retrieve → rank → summarize. Cached per-ticket embeddings
  (one vector per scope), ranking in Node, top-20 candidates summarized by the
  chat model. Per-search AI cost is flat regardless of ticket count.
- **Provider master switch (`AI_PROVIDER`)** — one line per environment, never a
  mix: `openai` (OpenAI summary + OpenAI embeddings; the demo) or `anthropic`
  (Claude summary + **local self-hosted embeddings**; work). Embeddings run
  `local` (a small model in-app via `@huggingface/transformers` — no vendor, no
  key, no per-call cost, text never leaves the server), `openai`, or `voyage`.
  Summary via `@anthropic-ai/sdk` (Claude) or OpenAI Chat Completions (`fetch`).
  Feature hides itself until a summary key is set.
- **Ranking:** blended match + recency (`similarity + weight × recency`, recency
  halving every 180 days) → newer strong matches first; match stays primary.
- **Data model:** new `submission_embeddings` table (JSON-in-TEXT vectors,
  portable across the SQLite/Postgres backends; no pgvector). Two scopes:
  `admin` (full text) and `public` (public-safe text, only for `is_public`
  tickets) — so public search can never leak internal fields. The
  `(submission_id, scope)` composite uniqueness (which the upsert relies on) is
  created dialect-safely: the table is synced without `alter` and the unique
  index is applied via a raw, idempotent `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`
  (valid on both SQLite and Postgres). This avoids a SQLite `sync({ alter:true })`
  quirk that would otherwise mis-derive the composite index into spurious
  standalone `UNIQUE` constraints and reject the second scope row per ticket.
- **Filters:** application scoping (default context app, "All systems" option)
  and a time window ("reported/resolved in the last 30/90/365 days").
- **Endpoints:** `POST /api/admin/submissions/ai-search`, `POST /api/ai-search`
  (public, rate-limited), plus `/status` endpoints for UI gating.
- **Cost/abuse controls:** embeddings computed once (content-hash guard),
  bounded inline re-embed per search, ≤20 tickets to Claude, per-IP rate limit
  on the public route.

**To activate:** set `AI_PROVIDER` and its one key in `server/.env` —
`anthropic` needs only `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (embeddings run locally, no Voyage
key), `openai` needs only `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Voyage stays optional and is
reachable only via an explicit `EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER=voyage` (never selected by
`AI_PROVIDER`). Then `npm run migrate` and `npm run backfill:embeddings`. Full
setup, env vars, and the pgvector upgrade path: `server/docs/ai-search.md`.

**Verification:** all `server` unit tests (cosine, doc-level leak guard, content
hash, graceful-degrade) pass in `npm test`; a mocked end-to-end run against an
isolated local SQLite confirmed public results carry no internal fields, public
search excludes private tickets, admin sees full data, and the time window
filters correctly. The self-hosted embedding + retrieval half is verified
working locally by execution: the default `local` provider loads
`Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` and produces 384-dim vectors with no key. The live
provider summary call (Claude, or OpenAI) was not run here — it requires the
user's summary key.
